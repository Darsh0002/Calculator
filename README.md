# Java Swing Calculator

A simple **calculator application** built using **Java Swing**. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has a clean graphical user interface (GUI) and is a great example of Java GUI programming using AWT and Swing components.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface using `JFrame`, `JTextField`, and `JButtons`
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- `AC` (All Clear) button to reset input
- Input handling using event listeners (`ActionListener`)
- Font styling and layout management using `GridLayout` and `BorderLayout`

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
- Swing Framework

## How It Works

- The user enters numbers by clicking digit buttons.
- When an operator is selected, the first number is stored and the operator is displayed.
- The user enters the second number, and clicking `=` performs the calculation.
- Results are displayed in the text field.
- `AC` clears the screen and resets all variables.
