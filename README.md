# 🧮 Java Calculator Application

This is a simple yet functional **Calculator in Java**, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides a user-friendly interface using **Java Swing**, allowing users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers — just like a standard desktop calculator.

## 🧠 Overview

The Calculator project is built using **Java Swing**, a part of Java’s standard library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI). It demonstrates how to build an interactive desktop application with clean event-driven logic and dynamic display updates.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Java**   | Core programming language |
| **Java Swing** | GUI components (buttons, text fields, layout) |
| **AWT Event Handling** | For managing user interactions |

## 🖥️ How It Works

- The calculator consists of:
  - A **text field** to show user input and results.
  - A **grid of buttons** for digits (0–9) and operators.
- When a button is clicked:
  - Digits and operations are appended to the text field.
  - Clicking `=` evaluates the expression and shows the result.
  - Clicking `C` clears the input field.
